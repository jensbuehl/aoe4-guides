Source code for [aoe4guides.com](https://aoe4guides.com): Yet another Age of Empires IV build order page to:
* create your own build order (including video link, description, other meta information)
* share build order with others
* browse and filter build orders (e.g. by season or rating)
* manage your own favorite build order
* write build order comments
* illustrate your build order with AOE4 icons
* get less distracted while playing via focus mode
* export/import to/from the AOE4 overlay tool
  

Goals:
* Build order central for Age of Empires IV/4
* Focus on good UX (snappy, easy-to-use, mobile-ready, discoverable...)

If you want to participate, some basic knowledge in the following technology stack would be useful:
* vue.js
* vuetify
* firebase (appcheck, auth, firestore, cloud functions)
* vuex
* (maybe more)

Huge thanks to [Len](https://github.com/LENpolygon) who inspired me to start the project for fun. Just to learn vue.js basics, to use it for myself and overcome some
UX issues with other build order tools out there. :)
